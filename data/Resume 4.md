# Experience

Dec 2015 \- Present  
Intel Corporation, San Jose, CA \- Software Engineer  
[www.intel.com](http://www.intel.com)   

Intel has developed and put into production a proprietary HDMT IC tester. The HDMT Gen2 tester is in production at full scale, the HDMT Gen3 is at the late stage of the development. 

As a SW engineer 

* Designed diagnostics test plans for the HECC instrument of HDMT Gen3 tester, collaborating with HDMT Gen3 instruments leads to optimize test coverage. The diagnostics subsystem serves as a system level quality tool for the tester.  
* Designed and developed the diagnostics subsystem for the HECC instrument (the main tester’s instrument), created unit tests and integrated into the HDMT Gen3 SW product.     
* Designed and developed the diagnostics subsystem for other tester’s instruments (HECC Cal, BP MTB)  
* Supported in production and developed new features for the diagnostics subsystem for HPCCx instruments for HDMT Gen2 tester  
* Debugged and fixed numerous requests for support for HDMT Gen2 testers in the field. 

Intel has designed, developed and put into production a HDBI tester. The HDBI platform is a re-implementation of Intel’s HDMT tester platform using Altera FPGAs.

As a FPGA designer and verification engineer 

* Developed SystemVerilog RTL code and testbenches for custom IP (test instruction processing modules), targeting [Arria 10](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/programmable/fpga/arria-10.html) FPGA,  debugged and supported roll out into the production.    
* Developed SystemVerilog RTL code and testbenches for custom IP (event processing engine), targeting [Stratix 10](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/programmable/fpga/stratix-10.html) FPGA, also debugged and supported roll out into the production.


Nov 2006 \- Dec 2015  
Altera Corporation, San Jose, CA \- Test Engineer, MTS  
[www.altera.com](http://www.altera.com)

As a software and FPGA design engineer I was one of the primary contributors to the design, development, debug and production support for Altera’s proprietary IC tester \- ATS7 system, consisting of analog and digital (backend processor, bridge board and DUT data processor) subsystems

* Created functional and device level specification for the backend processor.    
* Designed, developed and debugged communication IP for the backend processor (Altera Stratix II).  
* Created functional, board level specification and board schematics for the bridge board.  
* Designed, developed and debugged FPGA configuration for the bridge board (Altera Cyclone 3\)   
* Designed and debugged data communication IP for the DUT data processor (Altera Stratix III).  
* Developed RTL simulation testbench for the digital subsystem. 

As a leading software engineer

* Designed and developed a major tester upgrade \- partitioning ATS7 tester into several subtesters. The upgrade rolled out to the production and resulted in significant test cost savings for Altera  
* Ported several tester software components from 32 to 64-bit Windows platform  
* Actively participated in ATS7 tester debugs supporting numerous products in the production testing. 

Sep 2001 \- Nov 2006  
Guzik Technical Corporation, Mountain View, CA \- Software Engineer  
[www.guzik.com](http://www.guzik.com)

* Developed, debugged and rolled out software for Signal generator (component of [ReadWrite Analyzer](http://www.guzik.com/products/head-and-media-disk-drive-test/read-write-analyzers/)). Contributed to FPGA design and RTL simulation.   
* Developed a few application level media tests \-  Media Scan, PRML Error.
